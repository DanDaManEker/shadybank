#$hady Bank Dashboard
##$hady Bank is a backstreet bank concept I created as a joke for a Sneaky CEO to have an overview of his live entrprise status.
- The entire Dashboard has a selection of different colors.
- All panel informations are interchangable by JSON files.
- Every panel can be folded up or down at any time
- Due to using the Bootstrap grid system, the dashboard is responsive and mobile ready.

##Money Transfer Status 
- This portion of the dashboard, interchangably by JSON, indicates three attributes: 
1. Complete money transfers until this moment in time.
2. Held money transfers until this moment in time.
3. Failed Transfers until this moment in time
- I also used chartist's chart kit. 
##Online Slaves
- This portion of the dashboard is a table that indicated the following:
1. Names of the Bank's workers
2. Location
3. Online/Offline status
4. last login date
##Rich VS Broke
- This portion of the dashboard is a chart that shows clients in negative next to clients in positive balance throu-out the course of the last four weeks. 
- By pressing the legend in the top left corner, you can toggle the "Rich" and the "Broke" from the chart.
##Money Stolen
- This portion of the dashboard is a animated, striped progressing bar that presents the amount of funds being held in the bank, as apposed to the next planned security breach, where all the money will be "stolen". 
- I alos added a Steal Money Now button, for when urgency strikes.
